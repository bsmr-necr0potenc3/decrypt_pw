========================================================

 A proof of concept which encrypts and decrypts passwords in the same way Ultima Online clients do in the configuration file (uo.cfg).
 
 The encryption procedure was obtained by reverse engineering of the 2.0.0g client and the decryption procedure follows from an inversion of the encryption algorithm but was later found in the client and confirmed to be accurate.
